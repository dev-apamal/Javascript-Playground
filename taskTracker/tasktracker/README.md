# Task Tracker Project

## Overview
This project is a simple **Task Tracker** application created using React. It allows users to manage tasks effectively by adding, deleting, and toggling the completion status of tasks. The primary goal of this project was to practice core JavaScript concepts such as array manipulation, event handling, and dynamic DOM updates, all while utilizing the React library.

This project is inspired by and based on the task tracker project idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker-js). Special thanks to them for the project concept.

## Features
- **Task Management**: Add new tasks.
- **Task Status**: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Dynamic UI**: The task list dynamically updates to reflect the current state of the tasks array.

## Key Concepts Practiced
1. **Array Manipulation**: 
2. **Event Handling**:
3. **Dynamic DOM Updates**:

## Technology Stack
- **React**: For building the UI components and handling state efficiently.
- **JavaScript**: For core logic, including array manipulation and event handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the task tracker interface.
